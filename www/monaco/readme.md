## Employee Directory ##

### Sample Application built with ***Monaco*** and *Twitter Bootstrap* ###

"Directory" is a simple Employee Directory application built by [Christophe Coenraets](http://coenraets.org/blog/bio/). The ***Monaco*** version of this app was build just to show how to build an application using ***Monaco*** features.

I've heavely commented on the code but if you have any questions please contact me at [abreu.marcos@gmail.com](abreu.marcos@gmail.com).

Refer to [this blog post]() for more information about how I rebuild the application using ***Monaco***.

The application runs out-of-the-box with ***Monaco***s *local cache* feature, but you can also run the application using the in-memory data provider or the other persistent layers available in the original application built by [Christophe Coenraets](http://coenraets.org/blog/bio/).
